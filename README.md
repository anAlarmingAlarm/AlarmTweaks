# AlarmTweaks
A tModloader mod that adds some minor changes to the game that I feel improve the Terraria experience.  
The full list of changes can be found here: https://sites.google.com/view/alarmingalarm/tmodloader/tweaks  
Every change can be enabled or disabled in the configuration menu. Some changes allow for further customization than simply on or off (e.g. the config option allowing access to the pylon network from anywhere can be set to never, always, or only when the player has a Magic Mirror or upgrade of it).
